Accurate forecasting of stock prices is crucial in investment profit making and risk-management studies. Traditional statistics and artificial intelligence techniques are widely used to study price prediction. Stock prices exhibit non-linear dynamics, making it difficult to forecast through a single model. Therefore, there is a need to develop hybrid models to make more informed decisions. The main objective of this study is to forecast stock prices using Artificial Neural Network (ANN) combined with heuristic methods such as Genetic Algorithm (GA). In this study, we used numerous technical indicators as the model inputs to forecast future prices. We developed a hybrid model combined of both ANN and Genetic algorithm. In this research, the statistical population comprises three US market indices S&P500, DOW30, and NASDAQ100 for forecasting. The stock data were divided into training and testing dataset. Model performance was evaluated using MAPE loss function. The testing results obtained reveal that for DOW30 and S&P500 index hybrid model accuracy is greater than the single ANN model. However, there was not much improvement in accuracy for NASDAQ100 due to high volatility.
